# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Resources

### Read or watch:

3.1.3. Lists
Data structures (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)
Learn to Program 6 : Lists

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
What are lists and how to use them
What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
How to use lists as stacks and queues
What are list comprehensions and how to use them
What are tuples and how to use them
When to use tuples versus lists
What is a sequence
What is tuple packing
What is sequence unpacking
What is the del statement and how to use it

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

### C

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

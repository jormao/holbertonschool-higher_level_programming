# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2-3 hours if you take the time to read and understand everything.

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

## Resources

### Read or watch:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
Object-Oriented Programming (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
Properties vs. Getters and Setters

## Learning Objectives

### General

Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
What is OOP
“first-class everything”
What is a class
What is an object and an instance
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is an attribute
What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
What is self
What is a method
What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
What is a property
What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
How to bind attributes to object and classes
What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
How to use the getattr function

## Requirements

### General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## More Info
Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings
